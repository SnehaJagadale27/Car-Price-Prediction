# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Project

🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.
The main goal is to help buyers and sellers estimate a fair car price using Machine Learning techniques.

⚙️ Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training using regression algorithms

Performance evaluation with metrics like R² score, MAE, RMSE

Predict car price based on user input

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling
